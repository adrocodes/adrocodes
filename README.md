Welcome to the world of [adro.codes](https://adro.codes/)!

- _ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on_ a side project that will never be finished.
- _ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning_ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) & [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)
- _âš¡ Fun fact:_ it may or may not be Monday right now. Crazy!

Most of my time at work is spent on Jamstack style projects. I've gathered together different ways of working and wrote a article on what I am called [Module Driven Development](https://papers.adro.codes/module-driven-development). If you're looking for a way to improve productivity & maintainability in your projects, give it a read. I only focus on folder structure, no new coding paradigms needed to improve your codebase, pretty neat! Continue the [discussion](https://github.com/adrocodes/adrocodes/discussions/1) with me and other developers!
